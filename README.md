# iMessageAddingVideos

This sample project shows how video content can be added to an iMessage conversation using one of two methods. 

In the simplest case video content is added as an attachment, in the same way as video content which is added directly from the photo library 

In the other case video content is added to an MSMessagesTemplateLayout via the mediaURL

In this latter case with iOS 11.3 and earlier adding more than a few (6 videos on iPhone 7+) causes degraded performance and a crash of iMessage.
